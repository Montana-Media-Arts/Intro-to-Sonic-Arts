We are starting to move into conversations about editing and mixing techniques this week. These two terms are central to the idea of sound or audio production, which will be considered a part of and necessary to the practice of sonic art.

In this case, **_production_** includes time, technical skills, equipment, and the process of creating, recording, and preparing sound works (be they sonic art, music, podcasts, sound for film, sound for theater, etc.) for use, presentation, or distribution. Audio production includes the entire process of working with sound and audio, typically in a studio.

As you remember from [week 2]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-2/DAW2/), the studio includes a lot of equipment specially designed for the purpose of audio production. Much of this equipment is now duplicated, or has functional equivalents within the modern Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). In many cases, the DAW actually makes many tasks easier than they were in analog, tape-based studios.

## Editing

**_Editing_** is one of the processes that is potentially easier now in the DAW-based studio. **_Editing_** is the process of cutting, splicing, and arranging audio sections in relationship to time and each other.
