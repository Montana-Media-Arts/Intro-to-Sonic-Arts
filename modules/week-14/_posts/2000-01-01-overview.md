This week, you will have a few brief readings introducing you to psychoacoustics. Later in the week, I will post the specifications for the the final project that you will complete to finalize this semester. Following that, you will send the rest of the semester on the final project and final exam (more to come soon on that as well).

As a reminder, there is no zoom-lecture this week, as the campus is closed for the election (if you have not voted, go VOTE this November 3rd). We will cover psychoacoustics as well as information about the final next Tuesday (November 10th @ 11am, as usual).
