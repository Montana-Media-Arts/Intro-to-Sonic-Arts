As mentioned previously, all sounds in our world can be described or broken down into a series of sinusoidal waves, added together, with various amplitudes and phases.

Obviously, not all sounds, signals, or waves that we work with will be simple sine waves. The audio files that you have been working with in Reaper, visualized in the arrangement view, are clearly more complex than simple sine waves.

We will consider a complex wave, one that contains two or more simple sinusoidal components.

In the following example, we will explore this idea further.


**TODO** More to add, coming soon.
