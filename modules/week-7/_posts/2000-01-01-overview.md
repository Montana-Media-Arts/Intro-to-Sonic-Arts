This week, you will be considering two topics. The first is the practice of soundwalks, which as you will see, serve as a natural extension of soundscape that we have been studying.

The second topic will ask you to consider how our tendency to approach the world through a visual context differs from how it might be if we approached it from an acoustic modality.

This week will be a very light week to accommodate in the compression caused by last weeks late content release. As a result, you two assignments will build on last weeks work.
