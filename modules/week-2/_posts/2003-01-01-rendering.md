Obviously, none of this information is good if the audio cannot be bounced down and sent out as a finished project. The final step of the processes is _"mixing down"_ the project to a single audio file. You can then take this _"final mix"_ and share it however you need, since it is a standard audio file. This process, depending on the person and software/DAW may be referee to as;

- "bouncing"
- "bouncing to disk"
- "mixdown"
- "render"

Reaper uses the "render" terminology. However, I am going to refer to this process as "the mixdown".

In the process of the mixdown, all of the tracks in the project are "mixed down" through the "master bus" (we will get to that later as well). The result of this master bus is then captured as a new audio file, which gets stored on your computer.

> I personally think it is "best practice" to make a mixdown of your project at the end of every work/play session. This serves as a recorded stamp in time as to the status of the project. This allows you to go back and hear the progress to a sonic artwork over time. It also allows you to hear how your thinking or approach has changed.
