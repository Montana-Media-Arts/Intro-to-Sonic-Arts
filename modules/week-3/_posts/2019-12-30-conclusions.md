This week was a deep dive back into the topic of Sonic Art, as well as look at the idea of Soundscapes, and field recording.

Obviously, part of this process was that you learned how to capture audio for yourself, using your mobile-device/phone.

I hope you enjoyed the process during this week. We are excited to listen to your soundscape captures!
