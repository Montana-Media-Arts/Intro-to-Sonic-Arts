This week was a deep dive back into the topic of Sonic Art, as well as look at the idea of Soundscapes.

Next week, we will further consider the topic of soundscape, as well as look more into the ideas of field recording. We will also continue exploring DAWs. To that end, you will capture and edit your own soundscape work next week.

In addition to the response for this week, please keep playing in Reaper, so that you are feeling more comfortable by next week.
