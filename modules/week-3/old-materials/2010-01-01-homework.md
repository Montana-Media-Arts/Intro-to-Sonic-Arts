topic: Homework - Response to Sonic Art Discussions
---

For your homework this week, I want you to write a short response to the readings, video, and listenings dealing with the question "What is _Sonic Art_?".

More specifically, please write around two-pages (double-spaces, w/ 1-inch margins, and 12 pt. font). In this response, I want you to discuss;

- How you would describe _sonic art_ in your own words to someone who knows nothing about the topic?
- How is the practice of _sonic art_ or _sound art_ different from and similar to both _traditional art_ as well as _music_?
- Finally, please discuss or present any remaining questions you have about sonic art, as well as any excitements or fears you have about studying sonic art.

These responses are due to the Moodle by Friday evening.
