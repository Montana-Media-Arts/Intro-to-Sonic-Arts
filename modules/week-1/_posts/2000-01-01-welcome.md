# Overview of the Course

Welcome to the Fall 2020 version of the School of Visual and Media Art's (SVMA) introductory sonic arts course. For this semester, this course is being offered as MART 330 -- _Principles of Sound Design_. For those of you in the Sonic Arts track of the Media Arts BFA program, this course will also fulfill your MART 245 -- _Introduction to Sonic Arts_ requirement. Due to ongoing adjustments for the COVID-19 pandemic, we have combined these two classes under the MART 330 identifier.

That all being said, as the course titles imply, this course serves to introduce you to the field, practice, and technicalities of sonic art. You will learn more what the term _Sonic Art_ actually refers to later this this semester. Instead, for the time being, you can think of this as being an introduction to the world of sound and audio, as it relates to and is used generally for artistic purposes. 


## Objectives

At the conclusion of this semester, students should;

- Feel comfortable creating static sites with advanced HTML5 & CSS3 techniques.
- Be capable of using JavaScript (JS) to create "interactive elements" and manipulate the DOM.
- Be capable of incorporating external JS libraries, such as d3 or tone.js to create engaging sites.
<!-- - Have a basic understanding of the role node.js plays in web development. -->
<!-- - Be capable of creating a basic web-socket based web-app for multi-user interaction. -->


## What to Expect

This course will force you to learn and adapt to new technologies, while also thinking about design, and content creation. Some weeks will lean more technical in nature, while others will lean more creative-based.

Just as the content focus will shift, so to will the work amount. Some weeks, especially those when new topics are being introduced, have a heavier workload. The goal of this is to make you practice with these new technologies and techniques. Other weeks will slow down and allow you to practice at a more exploratory pace.

You should plan;

- 3 hours a week to work through the course website content (what you are doing now).
- 3-9 hours a week to work on concepts, code assignments, studying, and practicing.


## Class Goals

There are 4 high-level goals for this course;

1. Learn how to problem solve. (More specifically, how to break a problem down into sub-problems that are easier to solve by themselves)
2. Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. (Skills acquisition.)
3. Combine technical and artistic practices through inquiry and iteration.
4. Adopt and use professional practices.
