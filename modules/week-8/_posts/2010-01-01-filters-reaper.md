Now that you have gone over some basic filter types, I want to just touch base on the specifics of using filters in Reaper.

## Adding Plug-Ins

To add a plug-in, either click on the slot in the plug-in chain where you want to insert a plug-in, or click the FX button and then select the plug in you want.

## Automation

As with track gain and panning, Reaper allows for the automation of individual parameters for any available plug-in.

If you open a tracks automation window after adding a plug-in, there should be a number of new choices for parameters to automate. Selecting one of these parameters will add a new automation lane below your audio file.

You can now automate this plug-ins parameters in any of the ways described last week for plug-in automation.

Likewise, if you have your session in one of the global automation modes, then it will automatically record the automation.
