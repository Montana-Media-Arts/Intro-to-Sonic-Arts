One of the qualities that defines a sonic event is its (and your) relationship to space. When we talk about **space**, we may be referring to where a sound is occurring, how large or small of a space the sound is occurring in, the acoustic qualities of the materials in the space, and so on.

These qualities that help determine a sounds relationship to space give listeners a sense of where a sound is. Likewise, space or a sounds relationship to space also influence how we perceive the relationships between multiple sonic events in space.
