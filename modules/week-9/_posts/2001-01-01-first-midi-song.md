Now that you have had a chance to explore MIDI on your own terms. I want you to follow up by watching and following along with Kenny Gioia's official Reaper videos, where he teaches you, "Your First MIDI Song".

I want you to watch and follow along to these tutorials, as they show you a lot of specific Reaper techniques and approaches.
