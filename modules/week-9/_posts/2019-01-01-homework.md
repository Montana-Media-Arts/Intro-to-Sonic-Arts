For your homework this week, you are asked to create a work that explores looping. This work can be contemporary/popular/dance-type music, or this work can be experimental in nature. You are welcome to utilize MIDI, audio loops, or both. 

# Deliverables

To submit your homework, please:

1. bounce out your finished work to a 2-track file
2. take a few screen shots demonstrating your session setup
3. write a response to your work this week, discussing:
   - which assignment you picked
   - what you enjoyed about working with MIDI
   - what ideas that sparked for the future
   - and what problems you had

Finally, in addition, you should plan in responding to at least 2 of your fellow classmates posts on the Moodle Submission Forum.
