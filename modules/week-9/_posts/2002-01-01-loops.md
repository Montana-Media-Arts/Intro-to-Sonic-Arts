# What is a Loop?

A loop, in audio terms, is an audio file or chunk that is repeated. Typically, a loop will exhibit a pattern of "beats" that when looped, maintain a sense of regularity and motion. As an example, even you just repeating, _"1, 2, 3, 4"_ repeatedly, at a consistent tempo or speed, creates a rhythmic repeating loop.

We have explored how to use audio samples and files to create non-rhythmic soundscape pieces. However, it is also common practice for producers, creators, and artists to utilize audio samples/files in time-based, rhythmic, or more "traditional music" practices.

# Reaper on Loop Based Production

As with the First MIDI Song, the Cockos team, with the help of Kenny Gioia has created a series of wonderful tutorial videos on creating a song in Reaper using loop-based audio material. I want you to watch and (optionally) follow along, to Kenny teaching the use of Loop-Based production in Reaper. Again, I am choosing to have you watch this, as they do a remarkable job of also showing you Reaper specific techniques along the way.

I am embedding these videos below via YouTube, so that there are the options for CC. But you can also watch these videos (as well as many more) [directly on the Reaper website](https://www.reaper.fm/videos.php#Jj2kpds_GgI).
