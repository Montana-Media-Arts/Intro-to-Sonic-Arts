So far this semester, you have learned a little bit about microphones and recording during the [field recording]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-3/field-recording/) and [recording in Reaper]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-5/record-in-reaper/) content pages. However, we have not yet gone into great detail about what a microphone is, how they work, and additional information about recording modes in Reaper.

Microphones are _transducers_. A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another. In the case of a microphone, it converts mechanical acoustic energy into electrical energy. This energy is then capable of being transmitted down a mic cable to a microphone preamplifier.

As a point of reference, a speaker (also sometimes referred to as _sound monitor_) is also a transducer. However, whereas a microphone converts mechanical energy to electrical, a speaker converts electrical energy to mechanical acoustic energy.

## **_{ TODO: }_** Reading

Please read the following two chapters from the University of Indian's "Introduction to Computer Music" text on cables and microphones to dive deeper into this topic:
