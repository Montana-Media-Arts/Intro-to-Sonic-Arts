**Due: Wednesday, November 18th @ 11:59pm**

Building on all of the diverse and extensive work that you have engaged in over the course of this semester, you are expected to create a final sonic art work for this course.

## Open Topic, Style, or Source

This final artwork can be whatever you want it to be, with respect to topic, style, or source. As some examples;

- you could create another soundscape or soundwalk piece
- you could revisit synthesis and MIDI to create something more musical in nature
- you could improvise a real-time piece similar to week 9, that you then touch-up in Reaper
- you could capture yourself reciting text in the form of a podcast
- you could record your band and mix it together
- you could create a piece that explores a specific principle of sound or psychoacoustics

You are literally free to do whatever, as long as it is sound-based and utilizes techniques presented and explored throughout this course.

## Technical Specifications

For this work, you need to adhere to or accomplish the following technical specifications;

1. **Final File Type** - This work should be exported as a stereo, digital audio file (`.wav.` or `.aiff`), with a sample rate of 441.kHz or 48kHz, and a bit depth of 24bits.
2. **Time Requirements** - Your final work should be between 1:30 and 8:00 minutes.
3. **Work Investment** - Since this is a final project, you should plan to invest approximately 2 weeks worth of a normal homework assignment times requirement. I.E. if it normally takes you 3-6 hours to complete a homework assignment for this course, you should plan on a final project that you think will take you between 6-12 work hours.
4. **Final Amplitude Levels** - You should ensure that your final audio file contains no clipping or amplitude overages (i.e. amplitude or peaks above $$0.0dBFS$$). Ideally, you should aim to have a file with an amplitude peak of $$-1.0dBFS$$.

## Deliverables

In addition to a digital audio file (as mentioned above) which constitutes the actual sonic art work, you will need to supply a number of additional materials.

- A 1-2 page discussion about this work. Please write about;
	- what you were working to accomplish with this work
	- what techniques, concepts, or artistic styles you decided to build on from this semester
	- finally, I would like you to also discuss briefly what skills or techniques you feel like you wanted to covered this semester that we did not get to
- Images of your Reaper session.
- Your _bounced_ stereo audio file


## Submission

Please, upload these final project files to the Moodle _Final Project Submission Forum_.

## Classmate Responses

In addition to submitting your own final project, you are expected to experience, comment, and critique your fellow classmates final projects as well (following in the model established earlier this semester).

You do not need to read through their final project discussion papers.

Presumably, you will need to return to the moodle shell _after_ you submit your final project to listen to and comment on your classmates works.

### Specification

- **Number:** You are expected to listen to and comment on **every** final project submission that is available.
- **Due Date:** You will have until Monday, November 23rd @ 11:59pm to listen to comment on your classmates projects.

This will take a significant amount of time, so please plan accordingly between Thursday (November 19th) and Monday (November 23rd) to get these done.
