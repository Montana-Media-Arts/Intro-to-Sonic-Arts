For those wanting to further your studies with sound, there are a number of options at the University of Montana.

## Sonic Arts in SVMA

Within the School of Visual and Media Arts, we offer a number of additional sound-based courses you may want to consider later on.

1. **MART 330 - Principles of Sound Design** — In the near future, what is currently MART 330 (the course you are currently enrolled within) will be transitioned to  MART 245 - Introduction to Sonic Art. After that occurs (likely next academic year), MART 330 will become a new intermediate sonic arts course. If you are around at the time of offering, you will be welcome to repeat MART 330 or work with the SVMA adviser to identify another way of registering for that course.
2. **MART 445 - Sound for Digital Media** — This course is an advanced studio-based course. Students will be exposed to significant artists and works, discuss aesthetics of sonic art, and create their own works in the styles of their choosing. MART 330 or MART 245 will serve as pre-requisites for this course. This class will be offered during the Spring of 2022.
3. **MART 420 - Sonic Programming** — At the University of Montana, the primary research direction for Sonic Art is in its relationship to Interactive Art. This course explores how programming can be used to create interactive sonic artworks. This is accomplished through the SuperCollider environment. I highly recommend this course, I will work with everyone enrolled to feel comfortable with the technology and to stay caught-up with assignments. This course will be offered again Fall 2021.
4. **MART 340 - Principles of Interactive Media** — In this course, students learn interactive art theory and techniques. Currently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this course is being offered via synchronous remote delivery. In this current iteration, students explore the creation of interactive art works (both visual and sonic) within the TouchDesigner environment. TouchDesigner is a real-time render environment that drives some of the most complex media productions on the planet, including; live performances, permanent installations, events like all of the screens and media for the New Years Eve Balldrop in Times Square, multi-screen performances for large shows, projection mapping, and virtual reality. Once this course can return to in-person, this version will be merged with the older version, which examined interactive theory through the medium of installation. This course is currently being offered every semester.
5. **MART 440 - Techniques of Interactive Media Design** — In this course, students explore interactive art theory and techniques through hands-on projects, working with Dr. Musick and graduate MFA students. Each time this course is presented, a new project will be devised, developed, created, and presented by the entirety of the class. This exciting opportunity offers students the ability to work on and create large-scale art projects, experience project-management, and develop skills in the student’s preferred areas. This course is offered in Spring semesters, including Spring of 2021.

## School of Journalism

Within the School of Journalism, there are a number of sound classes and podcasting classes that offer students the opportunity to explore using sound, radio, and podcasting to tell story and the news. If you are interested in these classes/experiences, I would suggest you reach out to Denise Dowling or Jule Banville.

## School of Music

Within the School of Music, there are a number of composition classes and music technology classes that offer students the opportunity to explore music-exclusive based work with sound. If you are interested in these classes, please reach out to Bryan Kostors.

## School of Theater and Dance

Finally, there are also two courses on sound for theater within the School of Theater and Dance. These offer students the opportunity to dig deeper into the possibilities of sound design and reinforcement for theatrical settings. Please reach out to Mike Post, if you are interested in these courses.

## Advising

In addition to utilizing your assigned university adviser, I am more than happy to meet with and discuss sonic art classes (or anything around sound or interactive art). If you are curious or confused about opportunities within SVMA or more generally in the College of the Arts and Media (CAM) or University, please feel free to reach out to me. I am also happy to discuss career paths and ways of preparing yourself for after graduation, for anyone wanting to work with sound for their careers.
